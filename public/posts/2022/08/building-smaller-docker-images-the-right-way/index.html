<p>This article will help you write smaller docker images that will lead to more efficient and secure docker containers.</p>
<p><strong>Buckle up ! — We are going to be reducing the docker image size from a whopping 536MB to 263MB and then finally to 65.8MB.</strong></p>
<p>The application that we are dockerizing here is a simple flask application that runs on python with these <a href="https://github.com/sanjayBala/flask-docker-example/blob/master/requirements.txt">requirements</a>.</p>
<h2 id="0-getting-ready">0. Getting Ready</h2>
<p>Assuming you have a recent version of docker installed on your computer, do the following</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can also build, and run the docker containers to test out the application</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When the container is running, you should see a simple page like so.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2364/1*OG0r_1WYClfNX57BCAFd5w.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="1-docker--the-wrong-way">1. Docker — the “wrong” way</h2>
<p>We are going to use a <em>naive</em> approach — a Debian image.</p>
<p>Even this dockerfile has something good going, <em><strong>there is only one RUN command</strong></em>, just one layer by chaining all the shell commands you want to run.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There is nothing wrong with this Dockerfile, our application works great and is easy to understand. Although the size of this image is 500MB+, which can definitely grow exponentially when we install more pip packages.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To fix this, we could choose an alternative docker image to build from, perhaps an alpine based image, which has the least number of pre-installed packages and so makes the image as smaller.</p>
<p>Which brings us to our next section…</p>
<h2 id="2-using-the-right-image">2. Using the right image</h2>
<p>Choosing the python:3-alpine image(python 3 is pre-installed here so less work), leads us to minor changes to the dockerfile, like adding build tools g++, etc since that does not come shipped with the alpine image and then doing the actual pip install.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This reduces the image size to 263 MB, which is great, but the alpine image was only 45 MB to start with. So we added about 200MB of packages.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="3-leveraging-multi-stage-builds">3. Leveraging multi-stage builds</h2>
<p>Taking it one step further, thinking about our situation for a minute — all we need is just the pip packages, not the gcc/g++ build dependencies.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a way to use only the files we need and push them into another image — Enter Multi-stage builds.</p>
<p>Multi-stage builds are a nifty way to build an application’s packages in a container, and then copy only the files/artifacts/binaries to the final container without the dependencies — this helps us make our image size a lot lot smaller!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This Dockerfile essentially makes two “containers”,</p>
<h3 id="the-first-container-alias-builder">The first container (alias builder)</h3>
<p>The first one installs the build dependencies, but this time we install all the pip requirements to a python virtual environment directory /opt/venv .</p>
<h3 id="the-second-and-final-container">The second and final container</h3>
<p>The second container is fresh from the alpine image, and only copies the /opt/venv directory which contains all the pip packages our application needs without any other build-time dependencies.</p>
<pre><code># this copies the virt-env folder from the first container into the second
COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv ENV 

# this directs the final container to use the /opt/venv packages
PATH=&quot;/opt/venv/bin:${PATH}&quot;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The second container is what makes the final image and is shipped to your Docker Image Registry, with no binaries or build tools — just the bare minimum needed to run your application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>This method reduces the image size to an amazing 65MB, when we started at 500+ MB, this looks like a great leap.</strong></em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="summing-up">Summing Up</h2>
<p>Multi-stage builds can be used even when building from source, and are not only limited to python virtual-environments.</p>
<p>Just a few simple practices to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pick the right image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only install the packages your application absolutely needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use multi-stage builds if possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use a .dockerignore (this makes sure that unwanted files are not copied into the docker image, like zips example)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always try to use the least number of RUN directives in the Dockerfile</p>
</li>
</ul>
